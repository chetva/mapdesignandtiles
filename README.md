This data set was an ArcGIS layer obtained from Yale's Cambodian Genocide Program Geographic Database (genocide.studies, yalemaps, https://services1.arcgis.com/7uJv7I3kgh2y7Pe0/arcgis/rest/services/CGP_Vector_Data/FeatureServer)

From the site: " For US bombing points, attributes of a siteâ€™s bombardment are displayed in tabular form, e.g. the date of the bombing, exact location, the number and type of aircraft in the sortie, bombing load and ordnance type, the nature of the intended target, and bomb damage assessment (BDA). Individual sortie payloads ranged in size from tens of lbs. to several thousand tons. The dataset details the 42 aircraft types deployed, including B-52's, and the 188 types of munitions they dropped, including 500-lb. 'carpet bombs', cluster bombs, fire bombs and 1000-lb. bombs..The US bombing database was released by the US Embassy in Cambodia to the Royal Cambodian Government and the Cambodian Mine Action Authority (CMAA) to assist in the clearance of unexploded ordnance.
